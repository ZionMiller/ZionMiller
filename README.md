## 👋 Hi, my name is Zion Miller. Welcome to my page! 

* 🧑‍💻 I'm currently a Software Engineere @ involve.ai

* 🧬 My current side project is BioBreak, a biotech stock data visualization tool

* 👌 I prefer Backend and often lean towards Python, but like everyone these days, often find myself picking up Front End JavaScript (& accompanying libraries) tickets

* 🏄‍♂️ When I'm not coding, I'm surfing

* ⚡ Fun fact: I was a professionally ranked downhill skateboard racer growing up
